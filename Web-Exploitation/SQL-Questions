SQLiLite
After trying some random username and passwords we come to conclusion of 
SQL Query : SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='  ' AND password='  ' ;
Hence it is vulnerable to the SQL injection input attack .
Therefore keeping the input as  : admin' OR 1=1--
so that the password statement gets commented and the Query becomes always true.

SQL Direct

To navigate the database and find the flag use following commands :
/du : To find the different roles and users in the database.
/dt : lists the different tables linked with the database.
/d table_name : lists the entire strture od the table
SELECT * FROM table_name ; : Displays all the contents of that particular table thereby showcasing the flag.
